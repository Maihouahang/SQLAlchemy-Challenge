# SQLAlchemy-Challenge

For this project, I will be using Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of Honolulu, Hawaii's climate database. Specifically, I will use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib to do a precipitation analysis and station analysis. After that, I will design a Flask API to create a climate app based on the queries that I have developed.
